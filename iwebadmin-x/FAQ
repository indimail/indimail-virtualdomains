ANSWERS

1. How do I use the IWEBADMIN_TEMPLATEDIR variable with 
   apache so that each virtual domain can have it's own set
   of html templates?

Answer: In your httpd.conf file, inside each virtualhost section..

<VirtualHost XXX>
 ...
SetEnv IWEBADMIN_TEMPLATEDIR /usr/local/share/iwebadmin/xxx
 ...
</VirtualHost>

Inside of the template dir you must place all the html template
files as well as the translation files.

2. How do I display the version of iwebadmin in the templates?

Answer: Put the hook "##V" in the desired html location.

3. What are html/header.html and html/footer.html for?

Answer: Each time iwebadmin sends an html file, it first sends header.html, 
then the template file, and then footer.html.  By default, the initial html
common to all html templates is in header.html.  Like wise, the ending html
common to all templates is in footer.html.  If you want unique header/footer
information in the template files, you can move this from of header.html and
footer.html information back into each template file.  But leave header.html
and footer.html empty, as deleting them will generate an error.

4. How do I include other files in the templates?

Answer:  Use the hook ##N<filename># to include non-template files.  There are 
a few restrictions in doing this:

    1. The file must be in the HTMLLIBDIR, or a subdirectory thereof.
    2. The filename cannot start with a "/".
    3. The filename cannot include "../".
