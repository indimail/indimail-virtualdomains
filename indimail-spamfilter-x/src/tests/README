1. HOWTO - HOW TO RUN A SINGLE TEST
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a) cd to src/tests in your *BUILD* directory hierarchy.
   This may be the same as the SOURCE, but it is recommended to keep source and
   build separate.

   To see documentation, be sure to install the automake.info
   documentation and run: info '(automake)VPATH Builds'

   Example: cd _build/src/tests # <- adjust the _build/ part!

b) assuming sh-compatible shells such as bash, run this to grab
   the proper source directory: (copy & paste):

   srcdir="$(sed -n 's/^srcdir = //p' Makefile)" ; export srcdir

   (if you use csh, zsh or other shells, you're on your own here)

c) to run a single test, run it this way, assuming you want to run
   the test t.lexer:

   $srcdir/t.lexer

   NOTE that t.frame contains the test setup and configuration framework.

d) The framework will run, for example, t.lexer and create a directory where it
   placed all relevant non-constant data, and print a message similar to the
   following, to show you where to find it and remind you to clean up after
   yourself:

   "Results are in ./lexer.20190614.  Remove it after testing."
