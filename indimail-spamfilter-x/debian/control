Description: Fast anti-spam filtering by Bayesian statistical analysis
 This package implements a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested
 by Paul Graham in his article "A Plan For Spam".
 .
 Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filter.  In its normal mode of
 operation, it takes an email message or other text on standard input,
 does a statistical check against lists of "good" and "bad" words, and
 returns a status code indicating whether or not the message is spam.
 Bogofilter is designed with fast algorithms (including Berkeley DB system),
 coded directly in C, and tuned for speed, so it can be used for production
 by sites that process a lot of mail.
 .
 This version substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing smarter
 lexical analysis.  In particular, hostnames and IP addresses are retained
 as recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA
 cruft such as dates and message-IDs are discarded so as not to bloat
 the word lists.
