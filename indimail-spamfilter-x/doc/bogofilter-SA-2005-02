1. Background
=============

Bogofilter is a software package for classifying a message as spam or
non-spam.  It uses a data base to store words and must be trained
which messages are spam and non-spam. It uses the probabilities of
individual words for classifying the message.

Note that the bogofilter project is issuing security announcements only
for current "stable" releases, and not necessarily for past "stable"
releases.

2. Problem description
======================

Bogofilter's/bogolexer's input handling in version 0.96.2 was not
keeping track of its output buffers properly and could overrun a heap
buffer if the input contained words whose length exceeded 16,384 bytes,
the size of flex's input buffer. A "word" here refers to a contiguous
run of input octets that was not '_' and did not match at least one of
ispunct(), iscntrl() or isspace().

3. Impact
=========

Vulnerable bogofilter and bogolexer applications corrupt their heap and
crash. The consequences are dependent on the local configuration which
is up to the user; in common configurations, messages would be placed
back in the mail queue and ultimately be returned to the sender when the
mail queue lifetime expired, or they might be processed as though
bogofilter had classified them as "ham".

The bogofilter maintainers are not aware of exploits against this
vulnerability in the wild.

4. Solution
===========

Upgrade your bogofilter to version 1.0.1 (or a newer release).
