fetchmail-6.4.5 (released 2020-05-07, 27596 LoC):

## REGRESSION FIX:
* fetchmail 6.4.0 and 6.4.1 changed the resolution of the home directory
  in a way that requires SUSv4 semantics of realpath(), which leads to
  'Cannot find absolute path for... directory' error messages followed by aborts
  on systems where realpath() follows strict SUSv2 semantics and returns
  EINVAL if the 2nd argument is NULL.

  On such systems, for instance, Solaris 10, fetchmail requires PATH_MAX to be
  defined, and will then work again.  Regression reported by David Hough.

  On systems that neither provide auto-allocation semantics for realpath(),
  nor PATH_MAX, fetchmail will print this error and abort. Such systems
  are unsupported, see README.

## CHANGES:
* Add a test program fm_realpath, and a t.realpath script, neither to be
  installed. These will test resolution of the current working directory.

# KNOWN BUGS AND WORKAROUNDS
  (This section floats upwards through the NEWS file so it stays with the
  current release information)
* Fetchmail does not handle messages without Message-ID header well
  (See sourceforge.net bug #780933)
* Fetchmail currently uses 31-bit signed integers in several places
  where unsigned and/or wider types should have been used, for instance,
  for mailbox sizes, and misreports sizes of 2 GibiB and beyond. 
  Fixing this requires C89 compatibility to be relinquished.
* BSMTP is mostly untested and errors can cause corrupt output.
* Fetchmail does not track pending deletes across crashes.
* The command line interface is sometimes a bit stubborn, for instance,
  fetchmail -s doesn't work with a daemon running.
* Linux systems may return duplicates of an IP address in some circumstances if
  no or no global IPv6 addresses are configured.
  (No workaround. Ubuntu Bug#582585, Novell Bug#606980.)
* Kerberos 5 may be broken, particularly on Heimdal, and provide bogus error
  messages. This will not be fixed, because the maintainer has no Kerberos 5
  server to test against. Use GSSAPI.
