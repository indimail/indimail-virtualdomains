# See /etc/permissions for general hints on how to use this file.
#
# /etc/permissions.easy is set up for the use in a standalone and single-user
# installation to make things "work" out-of-the box.
# Some of the settings might be considered somewhat lax from the security
# standpoint. These aspects are handled differently in the permissions.secure
# file.
