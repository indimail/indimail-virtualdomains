   COPYING

   This library implements several algorithms related to the Unicode
   Standard, featuring:

     * Both C and C++11 bindings, with a complete manual page documentation
       set.

     * The library has all Unicode mappings compiled in as fast, compact,
       lookup table. The library does not need to load the Unicode database
       files at startup, every time.

     * The library implements lookups uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase
       equivalents of a unicode character; grapheme and word breaking rules;
       line breaking rules; and the bi-directional algorithm.

     * The library implements canonical and compatibility decomposition and
       composition of Unicode text; and the Unicode script property.

     * The library also implements ancillary functions, like looking up the
       unicode character that corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as
       “&amp;”, for example), and determining the normal width or a
       double-width status of a unicode character. Also, an adaptation of the
       iconv(3) API for this unicode library.

Current status

   The current release of the Courier Unicode library is based on the Unicode
   13.0.0 standard.
