Installation and usage

   Download the current version of the library from
   https://www.courier-mta.org/download.html#unicode. Use the downloaded
   tarball to prepare an appropriate installation package for your operating
   system distribution. The typical sequence of commands is:

 ./configure    # Takes the default configure script options
 make
 make install DESTDIR=/tmp/courier-unicode-instimage # For example.

   The library uses a stock configure script, make and make install command
   that respects the DESTDIR setting to create an installation image in the
   directory specified by DESTDIR.

  Note

   make install does not take any explicit action to uninstall any older
   version of the library, or remove any files from an older version that do
   not exist any more in the new version. Use the created installation image
   to prepare an installable package in a native package format for your
   operating system distribution. Use your native system distribution's
   package manager to properly install and update this library.

   To use the library, “#include <courier-unicode.h>” and link with
   -lcourier-unicode. The C++ compiler must have C++11 support. Minimum
   usable version of gcc appears to be gcc 4.4 with the -std=c++0x flag.
   Current versions of gcc use C++11, or higher, by default and do not
   require extra flags. For C++ code, as usual, the compiler and compilation
   flags for compiling any code that uses this library must be ABI-compatible
   too.

   The Courier Unicode library installs an autoconf macro to probe for C++11
   support. In your configure.ac

           AX_COURIER_UNICODE_VERSION
           AX_COURIER_UNICODE_CXXFLAGS

           AC_SUBST(COURIER_UNICODE_CXXFLAGS)


   Then, in Makefile.am:

           AM_CXXFLAGS = @COURIER_UNICODE_CXXFLAGS@


   The AX_COURIER_UNICODE_VERSION macro checks the minimum library version,
   which defaults to the build version. An optional parameter explicitly
   specifies which version of the Courier Unicode library is the minimum
   version required, i.e.:

         AX_COURIER_UNICODE_VERSION(2.2.0)

   AX_COURIER_UNICODE_CXXFLAGS sets COURIER_UNICODE_CXXFLAGS to the
   appropriate option for older gcc compilers that require an option to
   enable C++11 support.

   The starting point for the library documentation is courier-unicode(7).
   Refer to the included manual pages, and the HTML version of the man pages
   for more information.
