  Here's a list of tips and tricks to write efficient mail filters
  using maildrop. Maildrop - just like any programming language -
  can do certain things better than others.<br />
  &nbsp;

  <h2><a name="include" id="include">The include statement</a></h2>

  <p>When maildrop is started, it reads
  <code>$HOME/.mailfilter</code>, or some other file containing
  mail filtering instructions. Before doing anything else, this
  entire file is read and semi-compiled. Any grammatical or syntax
  errors will result in maildrop terminating with a temporary error
  code, without doing anything with the message.</p>

  <p>The entire file must be 'semi-compiled". The
  'semi-compilation' process consists of building an logical
  representation of the filtering statements in memory.</p>

  <p>If you have a long and complicated set of instructions, it
  will be semi-compiled whether or not it will actually be
  executed. For example, consider the following code:<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
  <pre>
if ( /^Subject: rosebud/ )
{
    ...
    some
    really
    long
    set
    of
    instructions
    ...
}
</pre>If the contents of the "<code>if</code>" construct are large,
maildrop may spend considerable amount of time and memory
semi-compiling filtering instructions that may never be used.
Consider putting all these instructions into a separate file, and
using the <code>include</code> statement to execute them.

  <p>The <code>include</code> statement is processed only when it
  is actually executed by maildrop. That carries certain side
  effects. One feature of maildrop is the semi-compilation which
  weeds out errors in the filtering recipe file, holding all mail
  and not doing anything until the errors are fixed. The
  <code>include</code> statement is not processed until it is
  actually executed. If there are errors in the file referenced by
  the <code>include</code> statement, maildrop will not know about
  them until it executes the <code>include</code> statement. When
  maildrop detects the error, it will terminate with a temporary
  error code, holding all mail. However, any filtering instructions
  before the <code>include</code> statement would've already been
  executed.</p>

  <h2><a name="linessize" id="linessize">The <code>$LINES</code>
  and <code>$SIZE</code> environment variables</a></h2>

  <p>These variables are initialized to the number of lines in the
  message, and the size of the message in bytes. They may not be
  exact, due to the presence of the From_ line, or -A arguments on
  the command line, but they will always be a reasonable
  approximation.</p>

  <p>Scanning headers for patterns will take the same amount of
  time whether the body of the message has 100 or 1,000 lines.
  However, the "b" option causes the message body to be searched.
  If someone sends you a 5 megabyte binary file, each pattern
  matched against the message body will take a significant time to
  complete.</p>

  <p>Whenever possible, the first thing you should do is check both
  variables to see if the message&nbsp; is excessively large. If
  so, divert the message to a separate mailbox, or reject it.</p>

  <p>Weighted scoring is especially sensitive to the size of the
  message being delivered. Normally, as soon as a pattern match is
  found, maildrop terminates the pattern scan. If weighted scoring
  is used then the pattern scan is immediately restarted, until the
  end of the message is reached.</p>

  <p>A fixed overhead is required to start a pattern scan going, so
  that weighted scoring that matches a very short pattern, like
  <code>/[:lower:]/:Dbw,1,1</code> will take a significant amount
  of CPU time to complete. Maildrop is simply not optimized for
  these kinds of situations.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, on a Pentium 200, /[:lower:]/:Dbw,1,1 perform
  reasonably well for messages less than 60K long.</p>

  <p>Here's an example of using <code>$LINES</code> and
  <code>$SIZE</code> to divert large messages to a separate
  mailbox:</p>
  <pre>
 
    if ($LINES &gt; 1000 || $SIZE &gt; 60000)
    {
        to "mail/IN.large"
    }

    .
    .
    .
</pre>

  <h2><a name="exclamation" id="exclamation">Partial matches using
  the ! operator</a></h2>

  <p>Maildrop implements the ! operator in patterns by breaking up
  the pattern into two separate patterns, which are compiled and
  executed separately.</p>

  <p>Whenever the first pattern is successfully matched, maildrop
  runs the second pattern. If the second pattern does not match,
  maildrop resumes matching the first pattern until it matches
  again.</p>

  <p>Since starting a pattern match involves some fixed overhead,
  minimizing the number of times the first pattern will match will
  reduce the amount of time it takes to match the entire
  pattern.</p>

  <p>For example: you're trying to extract an IP address from the
  first Received header. Here's your first attempt at doing so:</p>
  <pre>
 
    /^Received:.*![0-9\.]+/
    IP=$MATCH2
</pre>This will not work at all. From the manual page for
maildropfilter:
  <pre>
 
       When  there  is  more  than  one  way  to  match a string,
       maildrop favors matching as much  as  possible  initially.
</pre>

  <p><br />
  So this fragment will set IP to the last digit, or period found
  in the first Received: header, because the first half of the
  pattern will match as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Here's your second attempt, then:</p>
  <pre>
 
    /^Received:.*[^0-9\.]![0-9\.]+/
    IP=$MATCH2
</pre>This will work, except the first half of the pattern will end
up matching every character in the Received: header that's not a
digit or a period. Maildrop will then stop and try to run the
second half of the pattern.

  <p>Your mail server will probably put a left bracket before the
  IP address of the relay. Noting that, the following code picks up
  the IP address as efficiently as possible:</p>
  <pre>
 
    /^Received:.*\[![0-9\.]+/
    IP=$MATCH2
</pre>

  <h2><a name="shortcircuit" id="shortcircuit">Short-circuit
  evaluation using logical operators</a></h2>

  <p>The logical operators <code>||</code> and
  <code>&amp;&amp;</code> work in maildrop just like they work in
  C. Consider the following expression:</p>
  <pre>
 
    if (/ ... some pattern ... / || / ... some other pattern ... /)
    {
        .
        .
        .
    }
</pre>If the first pattern is found, maildrop will not execute the
second pattern, since the logical expression will be true no matter
what. You can use that to your advantage. If you have two patterns,
and one of them takes more time to process, put the other first.
Even if both patterns are relatively quick, if you expect one of
them to be found almost every time, put that one first so that it
will not be necessary to run the second pattern most of the time.

  <p>The same concept works for the <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
  operator:</p>
  <pre>
 
    if (/ ... some pattern ... / &amp;&amp; / ... some other pattern ... /)
    {
        .
        .
        .
    }
</pre>If the first pattern is not found, maildrop will not execute
the second pattern, since the logical expression will be false no
matter what.

  <h2><a name="foreach" id="foreach">The <code>foreach</code>
  statement</a></h2>

  <p>The <code>foreach</code> statement is implemented as follows.
  Maildrop will execute the regular expression, and compile a list
  of all the patterns in the message matched by the regular
  expression. Afterwards, maildrop will execute the
  <code>foreach</code> statement, once for each matched
  pattern.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that maildrop will create a list in
  memory containing every pattern matched by the regular
  expression. if the regular expression is found many times in the
  message, this will require a lot of memory. For example, the
  following is a Very Bad Thing[tm]:</p>
  <pre>
 
    foreach /[:alpha:]/
    {
        .
        .
        .
    }
</pre>Maildrop does not include any built-in limits on resource
usage, except for the watchdog timer. Therefore, as a system
administrator, it is your responsibility to limit resources used by
the maildrop process.

  <p>This implementation of the <code>foreach</code> statement is
  the one that yields the least number of surprises. Observe that
  the contents of the <code>foreach</code> construct can modify the
  message using the <code>xfilter</code> statement. Furthermore,
  the regular expression may include variable substitution, and
  those variables could be modified by the <code>foreach</code>
  statement. If the foreach statement were to be executed "on the
  fly", these factors would yield unpredictable - and rather messy
  - results.</p>

  <h2><a name="hometmp" id="hometmp">The <code>$HOME/.tmp</code>
  directory</a></h2>

  <p>Under certain conditions, maildrop will need to use a
  temporary file. Temporary files are created in the
  <code>$HOME/.tmp</code> directory. Temporary files are used to
  store large messages (instead of storing them in memory).
  Temporary files may also be used by the xfilter command, or in
  other situations.</p>

  <p>Maildrop will automatically delete all temporary files before
  terminating. However, if the maildrop process is killed, or
  terminates abnormally, a temporary file may remain and take up
  disk space. To have those leftover files automatically cleaned
  up, put the following code in <code>/etc/profile</code>, or some
  other file that all users run after logging in:</p>
  <pre>
 
    find $HOME/.tmp -depth -mtime +7 \( \( \
        -type d -exec rmdir {} \; \) -o -exec rm -f {} \; \) 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>&nbsp;
