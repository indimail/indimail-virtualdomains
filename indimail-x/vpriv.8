vpriv \- Set privilege for admin user to run IndiMail commands

.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBvpriv\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIuser\fR \fICommandLineSwitches\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvpriv\fR sets privileges for users to run IndiMail programs with a set
of command line options. The users can be created with the
\fBmgmtpass(8)\fR program. This allows access control on programs run by
\fBadminclient(8)\fR. \fBvpriv\fR can be run by the root or indimail user
user, or if the user has the indimail gid as a supplementary group.

\fICommandLineSwitches\fR can be a wildcard expresson or a regular
expression. If you want to use \fBregex\fR(3), then you need to define
\fBQREGEX\fR environment variable for \fBindisrvr\fB(8). An asterix (*)
allows all options for \fIprogram\fR.

The below command will allow user \fIadmin\fR to get user quota using
\fBvuserinfo\fR(1) program.

.EX
  $ sudo vpriv -i /usr/bin/vuserinfo admin '-q *'
.EE

The below command will allow user \fIadmin\fR to use all options for the
