.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBqmailmrtg\fR \fIoptions\fR \fIdir\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBqmailmrtg\fR(1) reads multilog output file \fIdir\fR/current and prints
output suitable for Multi Router Traffic Gropher \fBMRTG\fR(1).
\fBqmailmrtg\fR was written by Inter7 using the standard C library. This
version of \fBqmailmrtg\fR has been re-written using libqmail, a library of
general purpose APIs extracted from Dan Bernstein's qmail, reimplemented
and covered by the GNU General Public License Version.

Take a look at @sysconfdir@/indimail.mrtg.cfg for usage examples.
indimail.mrtg.cfg expects \fBqmailmrtg\fR to be in @libexecdir@ directory.
