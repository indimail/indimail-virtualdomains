CREDITS
-------

The credit for inspiration to write/put together this package is entire due to Dr. Daniel Bernstein.
Had he not written qmail the way it is written, i wouldn't probably have fallen in love with the code.
In no way is this package endorsed by DJB. Though I have put in lot of effort putting together this package,
any bugs or flaws could be entirely due to me. So I would be glad if the community could further improve this.
Since I have gained so much personally as well as professionally due to qmail, the least I can do is to put back
my experiences and learnings for anyone who would be interested. I release my entire code as Open Source GPL.

My contribution is miniscule compared to what I have picked up from others in building the packages. Since this
was being done for my own personal use, over the years, I may have missed mentioning some parts of the code that
has been written by others. In case you know that I have missed out giving credit to anyone for any of the code
or idea, let me know and I will be glad to add it here.
