.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBinlookup\fR(8) is a query caching, connection pooling server to
pre-implemented queries from clients. This request is initiated using the
inquery(3) api. \fBinlookup\fR(8) uses two FIFOs. One is a fixed FIFO for
reading the query and reading the path of a randomly generated FIFO. This
FIFO is created by \fBinlookup\fR(8). The other FIFO is created by the
client with a randomly generated name. This FIFO is used for writing the
result of the query back to the client.
.PP
Clients use the API function \fBinquery(3)\fR to use the \fBinlookup\fR(8)
service. The write FIFO is generated and created by the client when using
the inquery(3) function. The path of this FIFO is passed along with the
query to \fBinlookup\fR(8).
.PP
\fBinlookup\fR(8) uses the \fBINFIFO\fR environment variable to create the
FIFO to which clients will write. If \fBINFIFO\fR is not defined, the
default FIFO used is \fI/run/indimail/inlookup/infifo\fR. \fBinlookup\fR(8)
then goes into an infinite loop reading this FIFO. If \fBINFIFO\fR is not
an absolute path, \fBinlookup\fR(8) uses \fBINFIFODIR\fR to look for
\fBINFIFO\fR.

\fBinlookup\fR(8) handles queries to a MySQL server on behalf clients and
allows for queires to be cached as well as pooled for improved efficiency
and queries/sec throughput. indimail clients automatically use
\fBinlookup\fR if the \fBQUERY_CACHE\fR environment variable is defined. If
this variable is not defined, clients will directly connect to the MySQL
database. \fBinlookup\fR(8) helps in optimizing connection to MySQL(1), by
keeping the connections persistent. Clients send requests for MySQL(1)
queries to \fBinlookup\fR(8) through the function \fBinquery(3)\fR using
FIFO. Clients which are currently using inquery(3) are \fBqmail-smtpd(1)\fR,
\fBproxyimap(8)\fR, \fBproxypop3(8)\fR, \fBvchkpass(8)\fR and
\fBauthindi(8)\fR. \fBinlookup\fR(8) uses the MCD (Mail Cluster Definition
File) defined by the MCDFILE environment variable to load all databases.
The MCDFILE defaults to @controldir@/mcdinfo.  On start up
\fBinlookup\fR(8) can be setup into debug mode by giving '-v' argument on
the command line. If debugging is desired to be changed during execution of
the server, set the environment variable DEBUG instead. Debugging can then
be turned off/on anytime by giving the SIGUSR2 signal to the pid of the
\fBinlookup\fR(8) or pid of the parent \fBinlookup\fR(8) (in case of
multiple instance). \fBinlookup\fR uses \fIhost.cntrl\fR to getting the
parameters to connect to MySQL. If \fIhost.cntrl\fR is not present,
\fIhost.mysql\fR will be used. If both the files are not present,
\fBinlookup\fR will use localhost to connect to MySQL. Other defaults will
be taken from the file INDIMAIL/etc/indimail.cnf. \fBinlookup\fR(8) logs
all messages and diagnostics to LOGDIR/inlookup.infifo/current.

For a non-distributed architecture, you need a local MySQL database. To
connect to a MySQL database, needs the control file \fBhost\.mysql\fR. This
control file contains the IP address/hostname of the MySQL database
corresponding to the \fBlocal database\fR. If the control file
\fBhost\.mysql\fR is missing, programs will use \fIlocalhost\fR to connect
to MySQL. One can also use \fIhost:user:password:socket/port[:ssl]\fR
format for \fBhost.mysql\fR.

\fBinlookup\fR can be used to serve queries for multiple databases (as in a
distributed architecture). The information of all databases that
\fBinlookup\fR needs to connect, can maintained in the file \fBmcdinfo\fR.
Without this file, \fBinlookup\fR will use the \fIhost.mysql\fR control
file.

\fBinlookup\fR can be run under tcpserver(1) to respond to inquery(3)
request on a TCP/IP port. When run under tcpserver \fBinlookup\fR uses
TCP/IP sockets instead of FIFOs. Also when run under tcpserver(1), the
requests will not be cached. You can instead run \fBtcplookup(8)\fR instead
under tcpserver(1) to utilize caching.

You can use \fBdbinfo\fR(1) program to edit \fBmcdinfo\fR. For each
database that \fBqmail-smtpd\fR(8) needs to connect, the following lines
need to be maintained

.EX
 domain   indimail.org 1
 server   localhost
 mdahost  192.9.0.1
 port     3306
 database indimail
 user     indimail
 pass     passwd
.EE

if the environment variable \fBUSE_BTREE\fR is defined, \fBinlookup\fR(8)
uses tsearch(3) for a binary search implementation.  This search is
currently implemnted for User Query, Password Query, Host Query, Alias
Query. You can limit the number of search nodes by setting the
\fBMAX_BTREE_COUNT\fR environment variable. You can specify the -c option
to pre-cache the active login records. You can specify how far to look back
in seconds from the current time, for the active login records.

.PP
The program \fBinquerytest(8)\fR implements all the queries supported by
\fBinlookup\fR(8). It can be used as a test/diagnostic tool for
\fBinlookup\fR(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Sets verbose option.

.TP
[\fB\-f\fR \fIinfifo\fR]
Name of a FIFO to read query requests for back end database like MySQL(1).
This overrides the environment variable INFIFO.

.TP
[\fB\-i\fR \fIinstance\fR]
Start multiple instances of \fBinlookup\fR(8) (as given by 'instance') for
load balancing purpose. The default is one instance. If you find that your
queries are taking a long time, you can increase this value.

.TP
[\fB\-c\fR \fIactiveSecs\fR]
cache active records which have been active in the last \fIactiveSecs\fR
seconds. This works only if \fBUSE_BTREE\fR environment variable is
defined. Without \fBUSE_BTREE\fR, caching will be silently ignored.

.SH SIGNALS
\fBinlookup\fR(8) reacts to a set of signals.

.TP
\fBSIGHUP\fR
This lets \fBinlookup\fR(8) clear all cache.
.TP
\fBSIGINT\fR
This lets \fBinlookup\fR(8) to close all current connections to MySQL(1)
and reread the MCD Control file.
.TP
\fBSIGUSR1\fR
This causes \fBinlookup\fR(8) to dump all current statistics on stdout
.TP
\fBSIGUSR2\fR
This causes \fBinlookup\fR(8) to toggle the debugging flag. If debugging is
off, it is set to on and if it is on it is set to off.
.TP
\fBSIGTERM\fR
This causes \fBinlookup\fR(8) to terminate.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns on SIGTERM with exit status = 1.
