.SH NAME
vchkpass \- checkpassword program for IndiMail authentication

.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBvchkpass\fR \fBprog\fR \fIargs\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvchkpass\fR supports authentication for ESMTP AUTH option in \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR,
allowing the LOGIN, PLAIN, and CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 AUTH types.
\fBvchkpass\fR looks up userid in IndiMail's Virtual Database
.PP
As reflected in the \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR man page, \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR must be invoked with
three arguments: hostname, path of the checkpassword programs. If these
arguments are missing, \fBqmail-smtpd(8)\fR will not advertise availability of AUTH.
.PP
\fBvchkpass\fR reads descriptor 3 through end of file and then closes
descriptor 3. There must be at most 512 bytes of data before end of file. If it invokes an
\fIprog\fR, it opens a pipe duping the read descriptor as 3 for
the \fBprog\fR. The write end of the pipe is duped to descriptor 4
and the data which was earlier read on descriptor 3 is written back on descriptor 4.
The \fIprog\fR program is invoked when vchkpass doesn't support authentication for the
supplied login name.
.PP
For LOGIN, PLAIN AUTH types, the information supplied on descriptor 3 is a login name
terminated by \\0 and password terminated by \\0. \fBvchkpass\fR encrypts the password using
cyrpt(3) routine and compares it against the value present in the passwd database. The encrypted
password can be in DES, MD5, SHA-256 or SHA-512 hash.
.PP
For CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 AUTH type, the information supplied on
descriptor 3 is a login name terminated by \\0, a cram-md5 challenge terminated by \\0, and
a cram-md5 response terminated by \\0. \fBvchkpass\fR encrypts the
challenge with keyed MD5 using passwords from passwd database. It's compared with
response (3rd parameter) and if they are the same then vchkpass uses execvp to
run subprogram with the given arguments. If they differ then it returns -1.
.PP
If challenge and response differ, \fBvchkpass\fR exits 1. If \fBvchkpass\fR
is misused, it may instead exit 2. If there is a temporary problem checking the password,
\fBvchkpass\fR exits 111.
.PP
hostname is simply used to form the CRAM-MD5, CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5 challenge.
\fBqmail-smtpd\fR invokes \fBvchkpass\fR, feeding it the username and password, in the case
of LOGIN or PLAIN, or the username, challenge, and response, in the case of CRAM-MD5,
CRAM-SHA1, CRAM-RIPEMD, DIGEST-MD5. If the password checks out, \fBvchkpass\fR
exits with a status of 0. If password is unacceptable, \fBvchkpass\fR runs \fIprog\fR
You can have a chain of \fIprog\fR on the command line with the last \fIprog\fR being
\fB/bin/false\fR.

.PP
\fBvchkpass\fR does not authenticate if user is inactive. A user is active if one logs in using
IMAP or POP3 protocol. If \fBALLOW_INACTIVE\fR is defined, \fBvchkpass\fR will proceed regardless
of the user's active or inactive status.

If the environment variable \fBDOMAIN_LIMITS\fR is defined, \fBvchkpass\fR validates domain
expiry and password expiry set by \fBvmoduser(1)\fR program.

On successful authentication, \fBvchkpass\fR can execute a script defined by environment
variable \fBPOSTAUTH\fR. In that case, the return value of \fBvchkpass\fR will be the
return value of \fBPOSTAUTH\fR program/script.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBalternate_checkpassword_program\fR
Path to an alternate checkpassword utility which supports additional authentication
advertised by qmail-smtpd.

.SH RETURN VALUE
If the password is acceptable, \fBvchkpass\fR exits 0. If \fBvchkpass\fR is misused, it may
instead exit 2. If there is a temporary problem checking the password, \fBvchkpass\fR exits 111.

If the password is unacceptable, \fBvchkpass\fR runs \fIprog\fR. \fIprog\fR consists of one or more
arguments.

If the environment variable \fBNATIVE_CHECKPASSWORD\fR is set, \fBvchkpass\fR will run \fIprog\fR
on successful authentication and exit 1 if password is unacceptable.
